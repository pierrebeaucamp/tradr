// This file is intentionally without code.
// It's present so that service worker registration will work when serving from the 'src/main/assets' directory.
// The version of service-worker.js that's present in the 'src/main/webapp' directory is automatically
// generated by the 'generate-service-worker' gulp task, and contains code to precache resources.
